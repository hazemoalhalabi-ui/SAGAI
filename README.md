# Streetscape Analysis with Generative AI (SAGAI)

**SAGAI** is an open-source, modular workflow that uses generative vision-language models to automatically score and map street-level urban environments. It enables scalable, prompt-driven interpretation of Google Street View imagery using only a bounding box as input‚Äîrequiring no pre-labeled data, specialized hardware, or deep learning expertise.

üí° **Zero-shot. Lightweight. Fully deployable.**

---

## üåç What does SAGAI do?

SAGAI links together:
- **OpenStreetMap** for automatic street geometry extraction  
- **Google Street View** for street-level imagery  
- **LLaVA (Mistral 7B)** in quantized format for visual scoring via customizable prompts  
- **GeoPandas / Matplotlib** for spatial aggregation and thematic mapping  

It can:
- Classify urban vs rural street scenes
- Count visible storefronts
- Estimate sidewalk width
- Be easily adapted to **any visual scoring task** by changing the natural language prompts

## üß≠ Workflow Overview

SAGAI is organized into four Python modules:

![SAGAI Diagram](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/images/sagai%20diagram.png)

| Module       | Function                                                                                           | Version   | Documentation                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Module 1** | Generate points along the OSM street network in a bounding box                                     | v1.0.0    | [Module 1 Notice](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/docs/NOTICE_MODULE_1.md)  |
| **Module 2** | Download Google Street View images at each point                                                   | v1.0.0    | [Module 2 Notice](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/main/NOTICE_MODULE_2.md)  |
| **Module 3** | Use llava-v1.6-mistral-7b to analyze the images via prompt                                         | v1.0.0    | [Module 3 Notice](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/main/NOTICE_MODULE_3.md)  |
| **Module 4** | Aggregate and map the scores at both point and street levels                                       | v1.0.0    | [Module 4 Notice](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/main/NOTICE_MODULE_4.md)  |

<sub>üìÑ *Each notice includes detailed descriptions, version info, feature lists, and usage instructions for the corresponding module.*</sub>

## üöÄ Quick Start

SAGAI runs in **Google Colab**, with no installation required. Each module is a standalone Python script.

1. **Clone the repo** to your Google Drive:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI.git
   ```

2. **Open the Colab notebooks** for each module:

   - [Module 1: OSM Point Generator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your-notebook-id-1)  
     Input: üìç bounding box in WGS84 (latitude/longitude)

   - [Module 2: Street View Batch Downloader](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your-notebook-id-2)  
     Input: üîë Google Maps API key & üåç geographic data from Module 1

   - [Module 3: Image-Based Analysis with LLaVA](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your-notebook-id-3)  
     Input:  üß† select a scoring task (`T1`, `T2`, `T3`) or write your own prompt & üñºÔ∏è images downloaded from Module 2

   - [Module 4: Aggregation & Mapping](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your-notebook-id-4)  
     Input: üåç geographic data from Module 1 and üìÉ scores from Module 3
3. **Run the full pipeline** to generate visual scores and thematic maps for your city or neighborhood.

Each module is independent and can be customized or reused for different spatial tasks.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **In case of issues or questions**, refer to the detailed [module notices](#-workflow-overview) for each component. These include setup guidance, version info, and usage tips.

## üì¶ Predefined Scoring Tasks

| Task ID | Type         | Description                                   |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `T1`    | Classification | Urban vs Rural Scene (0 = rural, 1 = urban)   |
| `T2`    | Counting      | Number of visible storefronts (0‚Äì1-2+)         |
| `T3`    | Measurement   | Sidewalk width in meters (e.g. 0, 1.5, 2.0)    |

All prompts are defined in `module_3_llava_inference.py` and can be fully customized.

## üìä Example Outputs

A pilot case study is included in the modules:
- **Nice, France** ‚Äì A linear urban corridor following the Paillon Valley, characterized by mixed land uses and dense social housing developments in the northern sector.
