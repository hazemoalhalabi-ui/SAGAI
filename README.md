# Streetscape Analysis with Generative AI (SAGAI)

SAGAI is an open-source, modular workflow that leverages **generative vision-language models**, specifically a lightweight version of **LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)**, to automatically score and map street-level urban environments. It enables scalable, prompt-driven interpretation of **Google Street View** imagery using only a geographic bounding box‚Äîrequiring no pre-labeled data, specialized hardware, or deep learning expertise.

SAGAI automates the full pipeline: from street sampling via OpenStreetMap, to imagery retrieval, semantic scoring with LLaVA, and geospatial aggregation into thematic maps. Designed for **Google Colab**, it runs entirely in-browser for fast and lightweight deployment.

üí° **Zero-shot. Lightweight. Prompt-based. Fully deployable.**

## üåç What does SAGAI do?

SAGAI combines several powerful open-access tools into a unified geospatial AI pipeline:
- ‚úÖ **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** ‚Äî for automatic extraction of street networks within a defined bounding box  
- üì∏ **Google Street View API** ‚Äî for downloading real-world street-level images in multiple directions  
- üß† **LLaVA (v1.6 Mistral-7B, quantized)** ‚Äî for performing **zero-shot** scoring using customizable natural language prompts  
- üó∫Ô∏è **GeoPandas + Matplotlib** ‚Äî for geospatial joins, aggregation, and generation of point- and street-level thematic maps

It supports a growing range of tasks, including:
- **Urban vs Rural Scene Classification**  
- **Storefront Presence Detection**  
- **Sidewalk Width Estimation**  
- üß© And any other **prompt-driven vision task** (just modify the template)

## üß≠ Workflow Overview

SAGAI v1.0 is organized into four Python modules:

| Module       | Function                                                                                           | Version   | Documentation                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Module 1** | Generate points along the OSM street network in a bounding box                                     | v1.0    | [Module 1 Notice](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/main/NOTICE_MODULE_1.md)  |
| **Module 2** | Download Google Street View images at each point                                                   | v1.0    | [Module 2 Notice](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/main/NOTICE_MODULE_2.md)  |
| **Module 3** | Use llava-v1.6-mistral-7b to analyze the images via prompt                                         | v1.0    | [Module 3 Notice](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/main/NOTICE_MODULE_3.md)  |
| **Module 4** | Aggregate and map the scores at both point and street levels                                       | v1.0    | [Module 4 Notice](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/main/NOTICE_MODULE_4.md)  |

<sub>üìÑ *Each notice includes detailed descriptions, version info, feature lists, and usage instructions for the corresponding module.*</sub>

## üöÄ Quick Start

SAGAI runs in **Google Colab**, with no installation required. Each module is a standalone Python script.

1. **Clone the repo** to your Google Drive:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI.git
   ```

2. **Open the Colab notebooks** for each module:

   - [Module 1: OSM Point Generator](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/main/module_1_osm_point_generator.ipynb)   
     Input: üìç bounding box in WGS84 (latitude/longitude)

   - [Module 2: Street View Batch Downloader](https://github.com/perezjoan/SAGAI/blob/main/module_2_streetview_batch_downloader.ipynb)  
     Input: üîë Google Maps API key & üåç geographic data from Module 1

   - [Module 3: Image-Based Analysis with LLaVA](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your-notebook-id-3)  
     Input:  üß† select a scoring task (`T1`, `T2`, `T3`) or write your own prompt & üñºÔ∏è images downloaded from Module 2

   - [Module 4: Aggregation & Mapping](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your-notebook-id-4)  
     Input: üåç geographic data from Module 1 and üìÉ scores from Module 3
3. **Run the full pipeline** to generate visual scores and thematic maps for your city or neighborhood.

Each module is independent and can be customized or reused for different spatial tasks.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **In case of issues or questions**, refer to the detailed [module notices](#-workflow-overview) for each component. These include setup guidance, version info, and usage tips.

## üì¶ Predefined Scoring Tasks

| Task ID | Type         | Description                                   |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `T1`    | Classification | Urban vs Rural Scene (0 = rural, 1 = urban)   |
| `T2`    | Counting      | Number of visible storefronts (0‚Äì1-2+)         |
| `T3`    | Measurement   | Sidewalk width in meters (e.g. 0, 1.5, 2.0)    |

All prompts are defined in `module_3_llava_inference.py` and can be fully customized.

## üìä Example Outputs

A pilot case study is included in the modules:
- **Nice, France** ‚Äì A linear urban corridor following the Paillon Valley, characterized by mixed land uses and dense social housing developments in the northern sector.
